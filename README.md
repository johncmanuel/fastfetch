## Usage

first, install [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)!

then, clone the repo:

```
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/johncmanuel/fastfetch.git
```

finally, grab full path to preset and run fastfetch:

```
fastfetch --config ~/.config/fastfetch/presets/minimal.jsonc
```

you can add an alias in your shell profile to use fastfetch without supplying the full config.
